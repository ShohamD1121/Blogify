# Blogify

Blogify is a full stack web application that allows users to sign up, login, read, write, edit, and delete blog posts. It provides a platform for users to share their thoughts, ideas, and stories with others.

## Features
- User Authentication: Blogify offers a secure user authentication system that allows users to sign up and log in to their accounts. It uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication, ensuring data privacy and security.

- Post Management: Users can create, read, update, and delete their blog posts. The application provides an intuitive interface for managing posts, allowing users to easily express their thoughts and make updates when needed.

- Frontend Technologies: The frontend of Blogify is built using React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and ContextAPI. This combination of modern technologies provides a robust and interactive user interface.

- Backend Technologies: The backend of Blogify is developed with NestJS, a progressive Node.js framework, and MongoDB, a popular NoSQL database. NestJS enables efficient and scalable server-side development, while MongoDB stores and manages the data.
